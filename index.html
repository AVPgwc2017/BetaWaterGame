    <p>We add up all the bottles you collect in the game and, and send that amount of water in a water truck to a country in need.</p>
    <p>1 Bottle = 24 fl oz</p>

  <h3 id= "ourgoal">Our Goal</h3>
  <p>The goal is to make sure every person on the planet
     has unlimitted access to clean water. So that no one suffers from diseases like AIDS and lives a longer happier life.</p>

     <h3 id= "didyouknow">Did you Know?</h3>
  <p>About 700 million people in 43 countries suffer today from water scarcity.By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's population could quite possibly be living under water stressed conditions. With the existing climate change scenario, nearly half the world's population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030, including between 75 million and 250 million people in Africa. In addition, water scarcity in some arid and semi-arid places will displace from 24 million to 700 million people.</p>
